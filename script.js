const story =`
In the realm of shadows, where darkness reigns and the malevolent whispers of an evil sorcerer threaten the peace of the world, stands the ominous tower of the Dark Mage. For ages, he has plotted in the shadows, weaving his dark magic to disrupt the delicate balance of peace in the mortal realm.

As the lands are shrouded in darkness and fear grips the hearts of men, a glimmer of hope emerges from ancient lore: the Dark Mage holds a singular weakness, a game as old as time itself—rock, paper, scissors.

This simple truth becomes the last hope for the mortal world. Summoned to face the Dark Mage in his lair, a brave warrior enters armed not with sword or shield, but with the determination of a valiant heart and the will of a resolute soul.

In a final showdown, the battlefield unfolds on a simple console in an empty HTML. Here, the fate of the world will be decided. With each choice of rock, paper, or scissors, the warrior challenges the Dark Mage, each move bringing them closer to victory or defeat.

In this epic clash of light and darkness, good and evil, only one will emerge triumphant. Will the warrior prove cunning enough to overcome the Dark Mage and restore peace to the world? Only time and the course of the game will reveal the final verdict in this battle for the fate of the mortal realm.`;
